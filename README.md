# Score_prediction

Score Prediction
This is a simple linear regression project using Python to predict the score based on the number of study hours.

Dataset
The dataset used is called "student_scores - student_scores.csv", and it contains two columns: Hours and Scores. It was imported using the Pandas library.

Visualizing the Data
The data was visualized using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. Two graphs were created to show the relationship between study hours and scores.

Training the Model
The linear regression model was trained using the Scikit-learn library. The dataset was split into training and testing sets, and then the model was trained using the training set.

Predicting Values
Values were predicted using the trained model. A score was predicted based on a given number of study hours. The predicted value was then displayed on the console.

Evaluating the Model
The model's accuracy was evaluated using the mean absolute error. It was also displayed on the console.

Conclusion
This simple project demonstrated how to use linear regression to predict a score based on the number of study hours. The model showed high accuracy, indicating that it could be useful in real-world applications.
